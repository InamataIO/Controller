Texas Instruments HDC2080 Arduino Library
==========================================
*** NOTE: This library was originally from https://training.ti.com/how-interface-hdc2010-humidity-and-temperature-sensor-arduino-using-i2c
*** This library was originally for the HDC2010 and was converted to support the HDC2080.
*** forked from https://github.com/tinkeringtech/HDC2080_breakout to https://github.com/lime-labs/HDC2080-Arduino for use in the "Lime Labs Hot Slice" temperature and humidity logger project
*** contains fixes and cleanups generously provided by https://github.com/stickbreaker to fix behavior on newer ESP32 Arduino core releases
*** generalized the error handling to restore compatibilty with broader range of MCUs and Arduino cores.
